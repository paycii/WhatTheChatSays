"Question: ""tell me about quantum-physics""","Answer: Quantum physics is a branch of physics that deals with physical phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level. It is the study of matter and energy at the smallest scales of existence. Quantum physics attempts to describe and understand the behaviour of energy, matter, and their interactions in terms of particles and waves. It also seeks to uncover the underlying causes of these physical phenomena. Examples of these are the phenomenon of wave-particle duality in which a particle acts as both a wave and a particle at the same time, and the role of indeterminism in which the measurement of a system's state can be simultaneously used to predict and control its future behaviour. Quantum physics has advanced rapidly in the last few decades, leading to major breakthroughs such as quantum computer technology and the development of the field of nanotechnology."
